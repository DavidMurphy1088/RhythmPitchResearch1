Using swift I have an AVAudioFile of 10 seconds of a simple piano melody with 10 notes. I know the exact frames in the audio file where each note starts. How can I calculate the pitch the note was played at?

Using swift I have an AVAudioFile of 10 seconds of a simple piano melody recorded with 10 notes. How can I use AudioKit to 1) determine the start and duration of each note in the audio file and 2) determie the pitch of each note.

Using swift I have a short AVAudioFile of a simple piano melody recorded with 10 notes. How can I  1) determine the start and duration of each note in the audio file and 2) determie the pictch of each note. Please give example code that uses Apple's Swift code. Please ensure the example code provided will compile without errors.

very simple example which plays an audio file of recorded piano notes using an AudioKit AVAudioFile through an AudioEngine. The code must inlcude an amplitude detector to that is triggerd on every note. The detector's closure code must also be able to know the frame number in teh audio file at which the note occurred.

I have frame values from one second of an audo AVAudioFile that contains a piano note played. How do I measure the pitch of the note that was played in Apple's Swift code

which algorithm in Swift is recommended for performPitchDetection given that the duration of the AVAudioFile frame values is 1 second long and that the sound recordoed is that of a single note played on a piano

What is the recommended algorithm to prepare input from a short AVAudioFile of a simple melody for note onset analysis

Using swift I have a short AVAudioFile of a simple piano melody recorded with 10 notes. I know the positions of the note onsets quite accuraltey.
What algorithms can I use to determine the pitch of each note. Please also describe any techniques that would help 'clean up' the audio signal to make pitch anaalsis more accurate.

I know the positions in the signal where notes start. If I use FFT -
1) What segments of the AVAudioFile input buffer should I provide as input to FFT
2) Should any preporcessing be done on those segments before they are input to FFT
3) What technieus should I use to analyse the resulting FFT time domain to determine the note's pitch

If I read an AVAudioFile into an AVAudioPCMBuffer buffer what characteristics of the signal does each value in the buffer represent.
- amplitude

Please provide Swift code to apply the Hamming windowing function to the signal before it is input to the FFT. The Hamming function that applies Hamming will input an array of Float values that represent the audio signal's' amplitude starting at the note's' start position. The Hamming function should apply apply Hamming windowing to the signal and then output an array of Floats that will be input to the FFT

what advantage does Hamming windowing provide and how does it work

give sample Swift code that can analyse the output of an FFT and return the MIDI pitch of the note. The function should input the values output from the FFT transform

is there a website or tool that can take a recording of a simple pinao melody and determine the rhythm and pitch of the notes recorded?

==================
Using swift I have an AVAudioFile of 10 seconds of a simple piano melody with 10 notes. The sampling rate is 44100 per second for the input frame buffer which is a AVAudioPCMBuffer. I need to analyse the input frame values in the audio file to detect note onsets.

I smooth the input buffer to reduce noise by segmenting the inout buffer into fixed length segments. What would be the recommended length in millsecnds of ech segment?
Determine the average duration of a single note in your piano melody. Let's say it's approximately 1 second.

Choose a fraction of the note duration as the segment length. For example, you can start with a segment length of 100 milliseconds (0.1 seconds), which is one-tenth of the average note duration.

Adjust the segment length based on the characteristics of your audio data and the desired level of precision. If you find that the segments are too short and capturing too much noise, you can increase the segment length. Conversely, if the segments are too long and missing rapid note transitions, you can decrease the segment length.

I need to analyse the input frame values in the audio file to detect note onsets. I smooth the input buffer to reduce noise by segmenting the input buffer into fixed length segments. What is the best appraoch to detect note onsets in the array of segments

-Normalization: Normalize the audio samples to ensure consistent signal levels across different segments. This can involve scaling the amplitude of the samples to a desired range, such as -1.0 to 1.0. Normalization helps mitigate variations in loudness and facilitates accurate analysis.
Filtering: Apply filters to remove unwanted noise or emphasize specific frequency ranges relevant to the piano notes. Some common filtering techniques include:

Low-pass filter: Removes high-frequency components, retaining only the lower frequencies relevant to the piano notes.
High-pass filter: Removes low-frequency components, keeping only the higher frequencies.
Band-pass filter: Passes a specific range of frequencies and attenuates others. You can use a band-pass filter to focus on the frequency range of the piano notes.

Using swift I have an AVAudioFile of length 10 seconds recording an acoustic piano playing a melody with 10 notes. The sampling rate is 44100 per second for the input frame buffer which is a AVAudioPCMBuffer. I need to analyse the input frame values in the audio file to detect note onsets.

1. What other techniques should I use preparatory to analysing the audio recording for note onsets
2. What techniques should I used to detect the onset of notes?

Using Apple swift on iOS I have an AVAudioFile of 10 seconds of a simple piano melody with 10 notes. The sampling rate is 44100 per second for the input frame buffer which is a AVAudioPCMBuffer. I have segmented the recording into frames of length 1024 samples each.
I have correctly calculated the frame index number of every note onset in the recording.
For note onset I then build a time domain array called TT of the amplitude values for the next 1024 amplitude values after the note onset's frame index number. I want to use the time domain values in TT to calculate the frequency of the note played at the note onset.
What Swift code should I use to calcuate the frequency of each note onset?
